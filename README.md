Hazelnut Software Defined Radio
===============================

The Hazelnut is an idea for an inexpensive coherent direct down conversion 100Hz to 30MHz software defined radio receiver primarily for amatuer radio use. For now, see [this group post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hermes-lite/_xhZanzt9KE/SqQuimxHCAAJ) for more details. This project is related to the [Hermes-Lite](http://www.hermeslite.com) and shares common gateware components.
